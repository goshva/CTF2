If you know someone who works in this sphere, I would be thrilled if you could recommend them to us. It would be a huge help for us. Thanks for your time and support! Additionally, I'd like to mention that your acquaintances don't necessarily have to be sound professionals; they could also be people who know such individuals. If you have contacts in this area, that would be helpful too. I understand that this might be a bit awkward, and I appreciate your time and assistance.",
